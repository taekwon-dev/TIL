# @Builder

> @Builder lets you <u>automatically produce the code</u> required to have your class be instantiable with code
>
> @Builder can be placed on a class, or on a constructor, or on a method. While the "on a class" and "on a constructor" mode are the most common use-case, @Builder is most easily explained with the "method" use-case.

> @Builder 어노테이션의 위치는 클래스, 생성자, 그리고 메소드를 모두 포함한다.
