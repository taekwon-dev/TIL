# [JPA] find vs. get



### | find vs. get

> The difference between the two interfaces lies in the semantic of their methods. The CRUD repository "finds" something whereas the JPA repository "gets" something. While "find" might lead to no result at all, "get" will always return something otherwise the JPA repository throws an exception.
