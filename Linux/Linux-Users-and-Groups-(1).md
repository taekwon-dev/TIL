### | What are Linux User and Group Permissions?

> Linux/Unix operating systems have the ability to multitask in a manner similar to other operating systems. However, Linux’s **major difference** from other operating systems **is its ability to have multiple users**. Linux was designed to **allow more than one user to have access to the system** **at the same time**. In order for this multiuser design to work properly, there needs to be **a method to protect users from each other**. This is where **permissions** come in to play.
>
> The primary purpose of groups is to define a set of privileges such as reading, writing , or executing permission for a given resource that can be shared among the users within the group.
