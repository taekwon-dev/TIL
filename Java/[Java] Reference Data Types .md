### | Reference Data in Java

In Java, non-primitive data types are known as reference types. In other words, a variable of class type is called reference data type. It contains the address (or reference) of dynamically created objects. The reference types hold the reference of objects. All **reference types** are a subclass of type **java.lang.Object**. it provides access to the objects stored in the memory.
