# [LinkedList] Reverse a linked list

### | Question

#### Given the pointer to the head node of linked list, change the next pointers of the nodes so that their order is reversed.

#### The head pointer given may be null meaning that the initial list is empty. 

### | Code

```java
    /*
     * For your reference:
     *
     * SinglyLinkedListNode {
     *     int data;
     *     SinglyLinkedListNode next;
     * }
     *
     */
    static SinglyLinkedListNode reverse(SinglyLinkedListNode head) {
        
    }

```
