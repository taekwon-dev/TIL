#### It is guaranteed that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

#### Note that the linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) {
 *         val = x;
 *         next = null;
 *     }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public ListNode getIntersectionNode(ListNode headA, ListNode headB) {
        
    }
}
```
